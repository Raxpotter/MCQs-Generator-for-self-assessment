# MCQs-Generator-for-self-assessment
This project is a web-based application developed using Flask that generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from uploaded PDF or text files. It leverages the spaCy library for natural language processing to extract nouns from the text, using them to create questions with one correct answer and distractors. The app allows users to upload multiple files, select the number of questions to generate, and displays the MCQs with randomized answer choices. After completing the quiz, users can submit their answers and receive a score, with feedback showing the questions, their selected answers, and the correct answers. This project combines text processing, web development, and user interaction to provide an educational tool for creating quizzes from documents.
